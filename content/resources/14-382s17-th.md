  caption: "\_An 1875 illustration showing that the adult children's heights tended\
    \ to deviate less than the mean height of their parents. This idea suggested the\
    \ concept of \"regression toward the mean\", giving the concept of regression\
    \ its name. Linear regression is one of the topics covered in this course. (Image\
